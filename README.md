## Conferences

There are many popular conferences that may be worth attending. Each one has a different feel - some are more business oriented (i.e., vendors selling products) and others are more hacker oriented (i.e., focus is on the tech and hacking/defending things). Both are good and necessary, just different vibes.

- [BSides](http://www.securitybsides.com/w/page/12194156/FrontPage) are local conferences, frequently associated with a major city/town. Typically very affordable. There are many BSides of different sizes, so search for your own city, or start your own event.
  - [BSidesDC](http://www.bsidesdc.org/) - Washington DC event, typically October/Fall.
  - [BSidesCharm](http://www.bsidescharm.com/) - Baltimore event, typically April/Spring.
  - [BSides Las Vegas](https://www.bsideslv.org/) - Las Vegas event, typically August in the middle of Black Hat and DEF CON.
- [DEF CON](https://defcon.org/) - Las Vegas, typically early August, very large, hacker oriented with lots of villages and hands-on activities.
- [Black Hat](https://www.blackhat.com/) - Las Vegas, typically early August, very business oriented.
- [RSA](https://www.rsaconference.com/) - San Fransico, typically February/March, very big conference, very business oriented.
- [Schmoocon](https://shmoocon.org/) - Washington DC, very popular conference, hard to get tickets.
- [Derbycon](https://www.derbycon.com/) - Very popular conference, held it's tenth and final event in September 2019.

"Hacker Summer Camp" is a term that refers to typically the last week of July or first week of August. Black Hat, BSides Las Vegas, and DEF CON all occur that same week in Las Vegas, overlapping somewhat.
